The CustardLabs home page - a basic example of using a tiny bit of PHP along with Twitter Bootstrap to create a responsive web
page in less than a day.

Of course the "less than a day" statement is only true as of the initial commit, everything else is a bonus.

Copying/referencing is permitted for everything with regards to the code, except the output text/designs and anything that is otherwise

Pull requests for corrections/omissions welcome.
