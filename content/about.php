      <h2>About us</h2>
      
      <p>The CustardLabs team has worked with web applications for over 15 years, with a heavy lean towards PHP, and more recently frontend frameworks and libraries.
      We have over 6 years of experience developing membership systems as part of a larger organisation, but the applications and user base have matured to the
      extent that they deserve a dedicated approach.</p>
      <p>It was out of this desire to focus more on web applications for membership organisations that encouraged the launch of CustardLabs.</p>
      <p>We are a community focused company, attending conferences whenever possible to keep up with current approaches and exchange ideas with like-minded members of the community. 
      We make use of open source software as much as possible, and contribute back when we can.</p>

      <h2>Founder & Lead developer - Russ</h2>
      <img src ="/img/russ.jpg" class="inline_avatar_left"/>
      <p>Russ has been working with PHP web applications for well over 10 years, and has spent the last 7 years (since moving to Norway) mastering the Symfony framework
         and related technologies. Russ was one of the original developers of the membership system <a href="/projects">project</a> and continues to develop today
         alongside fulfilling project management and other admin responsibilities.</p>
      <img src="img/mbcs-logo-colour_300.jpg" class="inline_avatar_right"/>
      <img src="img/zend-certified.jpg" class="inline_avatar_right"/>
      <p>A keen rock climber and runner, you will find Russ frequenting the Norwegian forests and mountains, as well as travelling around to various races (e.g. Tallinn half marathon,
         Birmingham half marathon, etc.). Russ is proud to hold a few segment records on <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/5686802">Strava</a> and challenges you all to 
         have a crack at beating them!</p>
      
      <p>Russ enjoys making <span class="custard">custard</span> almost every evening, combining with fruit or home baked cakes. 
         Years of practice keeps the custard smooth, and restraint keeps it tasting good. 
         The mantra holds true for software development also, he believes it's possible to keep things simple, without stifling growth and innovation.</p>
