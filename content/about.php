      <h2>About us</h2>
      
      <p>The CustardLabs team has worked with web applications for over <?php echo date("Y") - 1997; ?> years, with a heavy lean towards PHP, and more recently frontend frameworks and libraries.
      We have over <?php echo date("Y") - 2008; ?> years of experience developing membership systems as part of a larger organisation, but the applications and user base have matured to the
      extent that they deserve a dedicated approach.</p>
      <p>It was out of this desire to focus more on web applications for membership organisations that encouraged the launch of CustardLabs.</p>
      <p>We are a community focused company, attending conferences whenever possible to keep up with current approaches and exchange ideas with like-minded members of the community. 
      We make use of open source software as much as possible, and contribute back when we can.</p>

      <h2>Founder & Lead developer - Russ</h2>
      <img src ="/img/russ.jpg" class="inline_avatar_left" alt="Picture of Russ"/>
      <p>Russ has been working with PHP web applications since last century, and has spent the last <?php echo date("Y") - 2008; ?> years (since moving to Norway) mastering the Symfony framework
         and related technologies. Russ was one of the original developers of the membership system <a href="/projects">project</a> and continues to develop today
         alongside fulfilling project management and other admin responsibilities.</p>

      <img src="img/zend-certified.jpg" class="inline_avatar_right" alt="Zend certified PHP5"/>
      <p>A keen rock climber and runner, you will find Russ frequenting the Norwegian forests and mountains, as well as travelling around to various races (e.g. Tallinn half-marathon,
         Birmingham half-marathon, etc.). Russ is proud to hold a few segment records on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/5686802">Strava</a> and challenges you all to
         have a crack at beating them!</p>
      <p>
        Russ enjoys making <span class="custard">custard</span>, combining with fruit or home baked cakes, although Bird's custard is a little harder to find nowadays, it still maintains
        a place in his heart, and the company name was a funky reflection of this (along with getting tired of trying to find a unique-ish name to use!).
