      <h3>Web application developer - full time</h3>
      <img src="img/PHP-logo.svg" class="inline_avatar_right" style="width:250px;""/>
      <p>
        We are looking for someone to help with the development of our core membership system. Candidates should be able to manage their own time
        and combine remote work with some office time at our Oslo location. Working language (documentation, tickets, project related discussions) is English, however
        Norwegian (or Swedish) is also highly desirable for some direct customer communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally you would be able to lighten the load on the existing team in all areas, so the list of "desired" skills is quite long, however we are
        of course open to realistic proposals. Most important is to get another (full stack) developer on board, it is not the end of the world if that person 
        is not interested in customer meetings, sales, office operations, etc.
      </p>
      <h4>Core skills/experience</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>First generation Symfony & Doctrine - required for development & maintenance of existing system(s)</li>
        <li>New generation Symfony & Doctrine - for moving forward with new development</li>
        <li>PHP - Main working programming language</li>
        <li>Some design/UX (html/css/jQuery)</li>
        <li>Some database interaction (PostgreSQL)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Other areas of work / nice-to-have skills/experience</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to talk to customers and discuss new functionality and ongoing issues</li>
        <li>Wordpress, Drupal, Git(hub)</li>
        <li>Ability to talk to potential customers, demo the system(s) and "sell" services</li>
        <li>API (in particular JSON, JWT based)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>About the job</h4>
      <p>
        Most of our time is spent working through new feature requests and supporting the operations of organisations using the
        membership system. Work is mostly carried out remotely, using tools such as Slack to communicate with other team members and customers.
        We also have an office location in Oslo for team meetups and closer contact with our customer(s). The company head office is based in Fredrikstad,
        so candidates from the Ã˜stfold area may be ideally suited as more frequent team meetings could occur there. We also travel to Stockholm around 3-4 times
        per year to maintain good contact touch with our customers there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going forward, we will be upgrading the membership system to make use of later versions of PHP and Symfony/Doctrine. This will also involve
        a large focus on a modernised UI and full-blooded API.
      </p>
      <h4>Renumeration</h4>
      <p>
        Base salary will be based on experience and set at an industry-standard level - however as a small company with a stable customer base, the potential for
        a rewarding profit-share bonus model is extremely good. We also support open source contribution (where relevant, e.g. Symfony/PHP/etc.) and attendance
        at conferences around Europe. Working hours are extremely flexible, and a good pension scheme will be discussed & arranged.
