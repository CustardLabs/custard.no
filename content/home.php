          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            Established in October 2014 in Oslo to bring focus to the exciting area of membership management systems. The company has since technically moved
            to Fredrikstad (by virtue of the company owner moving there!) but still works pretty much the same way, remotely and with periodic visits to a rented
            office in Oslo.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a small team with an experienced affiliate network, allowing us to work on small or large projects and keep overhead costs low.

          <p>Enquiries by telephone are discouraged unless your number is recognised by lookup services such as 180.no. Unlisted numbers, or those reported as sales/spam will be ignored, unless we are expecting a call.
             This is simply due to the high volume of unsolicited calls we receive, and the lack of any kind of secretarial service to receive and filter them.</p>
