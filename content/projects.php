        CustardLabs' original core project, developing, supporting and maintaining the membership system used by large organisations
        such as the <a href="https://www.scouterna.se/">Guides and Scouts of Sweden</a>,
        the <a href="https://www.speiding.no">Norwegian Guide and Scout Association</a>,
        and <a href="https://www.nm.no/">Noregs MÃ¥llag</a>
      </p>

        If you are on the lookout for a fully featured, configurable and extendable hosted
        membership/organisation administration system please get in touch with us: <span id="email_link">info{#}custard.no</span> or alternatively
        if you represent a membership organisation, perhaps get in touch with one of the above organisations, for a user-perspective of the offering.
      </p>

        There is no specific pricing model to display here, as the system is a collaboration project between its user-organisations. In summary, the system
        is somewhat free to use, with the expectation that you are willing to contribute back to it, so all can benefit.
      <p>
        The system is currently translated into English, Norwegian and Swedish and includes functionality for invoicing, activity management, reporting,
        statistics, Awards and achievements (and CVs), Email distribution lists, management of organisational elements (e.g. groups, districts, regions), NETS
        integration (eFaktura and Avtalegiro), etc.

      <h3>This website</h3>

        We are used to building large scale web applications, so it was quite a departure from the norm to create this website that you are reading now.
        As an exercise, we used Twitter Bootstrap from the ground up, to experience "hand rolling" a new, simple site without the use of larger frameworks.

        There is a small amount of jQuery and some PHP for basic routing and template re-use. In total, around 6 hours were used to complete everything necessary
        for launch. The next step will involve migrating the current solution to WordPress, Symfony or AngularJS, depending on the direction we choose to take it
        (a blog will be a likely inclusion, so WordPress would be a likely candidate).
      </p>
      <p>
        The site is responsive "out of the box" - one of the benefits of using a library such as Bootstrap.
