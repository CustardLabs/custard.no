      <p>
        CustardLabs' core project, developing, supporting and maintaining the membership system used by large organisations 
        such as the <a href="http://www.scouterna.se/">Guides and Scouts of Sweden</a>, 
        and the <a href="http://www.speiding.no">Norwegian Guide and Scout Association</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have just launched a proof-of-concept project on Github for end users of the membership system to start making
        their own interfaces, for example - an alternative slimmed down "my page" for mobile devices using AngularJS.
      </p>
      <p>
        More details about this exciting development, and all other information regarding this system will be revealed via a dedicated
        website in November. In the meantime - if you are on the look out for a fully featured, configurable and extendable hosted 
        membership/organisation administration system please get in touch: <span id="email_link">info{#}custard.no</span>.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is currently translated into English, Norwegian and Swedish and includes functionality for invoicing, activity management, reporting,
        statistics, Awards and achievements (and CVs), Email distribution lists and management of organisational elements (e.g. groups, districts, regions).

      <h3>This website</h2>

      <p>
        We are used to building large scale web applications, so it was quite a departure from the norm to create this website that you are reading now.
        As an exercise, we used Twitter Bootstrap from the ground up, to experience "hand rolling" a new, simple site without the use of larger frameworks.

      <p>
        There is a small amount of jQuery and some PHP for basic routing and template re-use. In total, around 6 hours were used to complete everything necessary
        for launch. The next step will involve migrating the current solution to Wordpress, Symfony or AngularJS, depending on the direction we choose to take it
        (a blog will be a likely inclusion, so Wordpress would be a likely candidate).
      </p>
        The site is responsive "out of the box" - one of the benefits of using a library such as Bootstrap.
